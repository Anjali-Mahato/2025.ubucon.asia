## Getting to Kathmandu

### Arrive by air
Kathmandu is served by Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM), Nepalâ€™s only international airport. Flights from major hubs across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe connect directly to Kathmandu.

### Arrive by train
While Nepal does not have a direct international rail link, only visitors   from India can travel to the Nepal-India border by train and then take a bus or car or a flight  to Kathmandu.

## Getting to the venue

The venue is just 20-25 minutes from the airport. You can take public vehicles like buses and mini-vans for a budget-friendly option. Alternatively, use e-hailing apps such as:
